One of them is the manual tolling system in bridges, flyovers, express-way etc. If we will build a system that will help these vehicle to pre-pay all of these toll via online then this problem may be disappeared.

If any of these information will negative then we don’t give the permission to cross this. That’s help us to avoid road accident and build up discipline transportation system in Bangladesh. </p>
